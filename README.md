# CleanData
Course project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course

Usage
Run the run_analysis.R script from the directory of your choosing on your system.  You will need to edit the setwd() function at the begining of the script to indicate the correct directory.
The script will automatically download the raw data and output a 'tidy' data file in the working directory called data_averages.txt.  The codebook for this data file is found in CodeBook.md
