# Tidy Data Project
Course Project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course

###Purpose
This purpose of this project is to create a tidy data set from a collection of raw data obtained here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

This data was collected from smart phones attached to a number of test subjects engaged in various activities.

###Usage
Run the run_analysis.R script from the directory of your choosing on your system.  You will need to edit the `setwd()` function at the begining of the script to indicate the correct directory.

The script will automatically download the raw data and output a 'tidy' data file in the working directory called `data_averages.txt`.  The codebook for this data file is found in CodeBook.md
